My project is titled "Developing a 3D dynamic microfluidic device of pancreatic beta cells and adipocytes to modelize multi-organ crosstalks during type 2 diabetes development".

The research is cofunded by I-SITE ULNE and Marie Sklodowska-Curie action within the framework of the European Commissionâ€™s H2020 programme. I am affiliated with Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics, and Eanotechnology (IEMN), European Genomic Institute for Diabetes (EGID), University of Lille (Doctoral school of Biology and Health), INSERM and CNRS.

My goals are:
- to engineer a lab-on-a-chip microfluidic device for beta cells and adipocytes co-culture;
- to develop the appropriate biosensory methods and to study the chemical signalling between these tissues and what role it plays in type II diabetes development.
- to derive a predictive model for insulin production by beta cells and to validate it experimentally.
